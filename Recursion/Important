🧠 Recursion vs Iteration
🔁 Recursion	🔂 Iteration
Elegant, clean code	Often faster
Risk of stack overflow	No such risk
Used for trees/graphs	Used for loops/counting
Overhead of function calls	Efficient in time

🧠 Tips to Master Recursion
✅ Always define the:

Base case → When to return

Recursive step → Smaller subproblem

Parameters → Pass only what’s needed

🔁 Think:

"Can I solve a small part and let recursion do the rest?"
